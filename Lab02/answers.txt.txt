- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
	No, because category and title both have the same datatype, that means both constructor methods have the same signature, therefore methods overloading cannot be established. In other words, JAVA does not allow us to do this.
